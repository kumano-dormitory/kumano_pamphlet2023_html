# Serve files on local machine
To run a server, you need to install `http-server` by following command.
```
$ npm install -g http-server
```

Once you've installed `http-server`, you can run a local server.
Please run this command at the top directory of this repository.
```
$ http-server ./html -c-1
```
then, you can access `http://localhost:8080/` using web browser.
